    "The domain model assumes that a User can create and modify multiple Badges, and a Badge can have multiple Images.",
    "The Image class includes methods for validating URLs and file sizes, as implied by the user stories.",
    "The createdAt and modifiedAt attributes in the Badge class are inferred from the requirement to track creation and modification dates.",
    "The relationship between User and Badge is modeled to reflect that a User can create and modify Badges, but the stories do not specify deletion, so it's not included in the model.",
    "The points attribute in the Badge class is included based on the requirement to add/edit/delete points for each badge and to sort the list by points.",
    "The general_notes attribute is used to communicate assumptions and important considerations to the developer."
